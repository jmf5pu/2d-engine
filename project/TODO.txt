* effects
    * bullet impacts on static bodies
    * dust after footsteps
* create enemies
    * build enemy sprites
    * implement enemy generator logic
    * implement animation assignment logic for enemy entities
* refactor bullet generation logic to methods attached to the weapon struct, so different guns can shoot bullets at different angles
* potentially bump up batch size of rendering - noticing occasional flickers when player is turning AND shooting
