immediate:
* figure out why bullets are being destroyed immediately
    * (thoughts) a BUNCH of entities are being created on bullet impact since they are hanging around for a few frames 
    and that is why everything slows down now that the impact entities have been added
* add logic for a couple different types of impact effects

other:
* effects
    * bullet impacts on static bodies
    * dust after footsteps
    * add logic to assign different muzzle flashes to different guns (attach to weapon struct)
* create enemies
    * build enemy sprites
    * implement enemy generator logic
    * implement animation assignment logic for enemy entities
* add reloading timer and animation
* potentially bump up batch size of rendering - noticing occasional flickers when player is turning AND shooting
* remove Sprite_Sheet_Frame struct, replace occurrences with animations
* redo hud sprites
* add idle player animations
* implement sdl2 mixer sound logic
    * background music
    * weapon shooting sound
    * reloading sound
