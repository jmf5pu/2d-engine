immediate:
* create anim for bullet impacts

long term:
* effects
    * bullet impacts on static bodies
    * dust after footsteps
    * add logic to assign different muzzle flashes to different guns (attach to weapon struct)
* create enemies
    * build enemy sprites
    * implement enemy generator logic
    * implement animation assignment logic for enemy entities
* add reloading timer and animation
* potentially bump up batch size of rendering - noticing occasional flickers when player is turning AND shooting
* remove Sprite_Sheet_Frame struct, replace occurrences with animations
