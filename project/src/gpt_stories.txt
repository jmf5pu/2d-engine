PROMPT:
Hello ChatGPT! I am working on writing the story for a videogame and I need your help. I need you to create a story for me that is interesting and draws players in while following the following contraints. The constraints are that the story must:

* have 2 main characters that will be represented by playable characters in the game at all times.
* These two players must be in the same side (the game is cooperative)
* the story, similar to the game must be combat focused
* the story must be comprised of 6-10 areas that will be used as levels for the game
* try to make these areas diverse from one another in terms of aesthetic
* said areas must be able to be represented in confined levels for "dungeon crawling" gameplay used in twin stick shooter games. In other words the areas of the story don't have to be dungeons, but they need to be represented in a confined manner at all points in the gameplay
* all areas/levels used in the story must have some type of enemy that is somewhat unique to that area/level. This can be a combination of enemies that chase you (i.e. zombies, animals) and smart enemies like humans that shoot at the players, you can decide
* said levels do not have to be continuous (the gameplay will be, but when writing the story feel free to bridge gaps between levels with exposition dump or prose)
* the story must have an apocalyptic or post apocalyptic theme
* the story must include themes of self sacrifice
